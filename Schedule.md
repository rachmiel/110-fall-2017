## <a name="week3">Week 3</a> (Sep 12/14): Legal Issues for Media Creators
As a creative professional, you need to be familiar with the laws governing the use of creative works--that includes not just copyright, but also trademark and patent laws.

- **[Exercise to Prepare for Week 4](weekly_materials/week3/vsCodeIntroExercise.md)**: Instead of doing readings for next week, you'll be completing an HTML tutorial on Lynda.com. You'll need to use an HTML editor to edit the files in the tutorial. In class, I'll be using VS Code, which is a powerful editor that is both free and cross-platform. This exercise, which we'll do in class on Thursday, walks you through using it for HTML files. If you would prefer to use a different editor, that's fine, but I won't be able to provide you with as much support. 

***Make sure you start on the tutorials for week 4 as early as possible; you're going to need to budget at least 4-6 hours for the sections due on Tuesday!***


## <a name="week4">Week 4</a> (Sep 19/21): Basic HTML & CSS</a>

This week you'll learn how to create basic web pages, using HTML and CSS. In class, I'll provide an overview of how these technologies work, but most of your practical learning will come from the HTML Essential Training tutorial on Lynda.com. 

You should complete the Introduction and sections 1-4 of the tutorial *before* class on Tuesday; the quiz that day will be based on those sections. To complete the tutorials, you will need to use an editor that can create HTML files. If you already have a preferred editor, you're welcome to use it. If not, I highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is free, cross-platform, and optimized for web development. It's what I'll use when demonstrating things in class, and in the in-class exercises. *(Note: You do not need to complete the challenge exercises in sections 3 and 4, but you should be familiar with the concepts they cover.)*

On both Tuesday and Thursday I will spend part of the class lecturing, and then will give you time to work on sections 5-7 of the tutorial; you must have those completed by the end of class on Thursday, and you will need to complete the challenge exercise  show me or the TA your work on the "challenge" components of each section to receive credit. You should plan to bring headphones to class on both days. (If you forget, there is transcription of the audio provided on the tutorials.)

## <a name="week5">Week 5</a> (Sep 26/28): UNIX, FTP, and Web Publishing
